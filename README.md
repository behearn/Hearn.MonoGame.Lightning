# Hearn.MonoGame.Lightning
Implementation of Michael Hoffman's lightning tutorial on envatotuts.

This version has been modified to fade out over a duration instead of amending the alpha channel by a percentage each tick.

The LightningStorm class manages multiple lightning bolts for a specified duration.  Clicking will restart the storm, jumping from the previous end point to the mouse co-ordinates.
